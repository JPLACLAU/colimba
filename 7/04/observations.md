# General observations Excercise 7-4

The program monthfunction.c is the basic program previous to the excercise. It converts a date format from xx/xx/xxxx to Day xx of month of year xxxx.

The main.c program has inside the same functionality, except that it uses "miniscanf", a narrower version of scanf. Just like in the previous exercise we used miniprintf, as a narrower version of printf.

We used a lot this function: va_list details of it can be found at appendix B7 at <stdarg.h> library.

I made lots of comments, since I used elements from a library I never used before: all the related elements to va_list from stdarg.h
