# General observations Excercise 2-3

In this case, non-hexadecimal characters will not be saved in the array s and therefore not converted into its equivalent integer value.
If I write "holaProbando1234" It will only save the hexadecimal chars "abad1234"
Therefore this loose of original information could induce to errors, but for the sake of the excercise I did it this way.
