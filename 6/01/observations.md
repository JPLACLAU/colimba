# General observations Excercise 6-1

All of these symbols are correctly ignored by the program:

// , "", /\* \*/ , \_ , ¿?¡!

# Questions

- I am not sure I understood properly the excercise instructions:

"Exercise 6-1. Our version of getword does not properly handle underscores,
string constants, comments, or preprocessor control lines. Write a better ver-
sion."

Since I did not had to modify much of the code and the getword function is handling propertly all the items mentioned above.
