# General observations Excercise 3-5

If I understood the instrucctions properly, we are simply asked to make a converter to hexadecimal. I am converting this number: 20221218 into hex.

That number in Hex converts to "1348D22". And that is exactly the terminal outputo so the program seems to be doing what is excpeted.

The conversion can be double checked in an online converter like this one: https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-hex-converter

# Questions

- I am not so sure how the "reverse" function works. I just understood I had to leave it there, from previous code. Maybe I am just tired. I ll review this later on.
