# General observations Excercise 4-1

The pattern "tal" is found and mentioned at which position it was found. There is a -1 when it is not found. However there is a bug.

<br> </br>

# Questions

- If the pattern is found more than 1 time, there are strange numbers in the output. see number "14" for the last line with duplicated "tal" pattern.
